1. GitHub: 
   - We store all code in GitHub repository
   - Use feature branches and Pull Requests
   - Collaborate with team members

2. Jenkins: 
   - Automates building and testing of our code
   - Triggers automatically when we push to GitHub
   - Runs pipeline to build the Angular app

3. Docker: 
   - Packages our application into a container
   - Ensures it runs the same on every machine
   - Jenkins builds and creates Docker image

This setup enables Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)!"
